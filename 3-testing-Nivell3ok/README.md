# Sprint 3

## Introduction

This sprint contains a series of practical exercises designed to learn arrays and object methods. Additionally, tests have been implemented to validate the correct functioning of each method, providing a more robust and reliable experience.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The main language used to implement the exercises.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run scripts and tests locally.
- **Jest**: A testing framework used to perform tests on the various methods and exercises. It provides a simple and robust environment to execute and validate function results.
- **NPM**: A package manager used to install the necessary dependencies to run the tests.

## Key Features

- **Array Methods**: The exercises cover a variety of array methods, including:
  - `.map()`
  - `.filter()`
  - `.reduce()`
  - `.find()`
  - `.some()`
  - `.every()`
  - `.forEach()`
  - `.sort()`
  - `.includes()`

- **Object Manipulation**: Exercises include creating, modifying, and accessing properties in objects.

- **Testing**: Each method and exercise has an associated test implemented with Jest to ensure the code behaves as expected.

- **Modular Structure**: The exercises are organized into separate modules for easier understanding and management.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with these exercises, make sure you have the following installed in your development environment:

- **Node.js (version 12 or higher)**: To run scripts and tests locally.
- **NPM**: Installed along with Node.js, used to install necessary dependencies.
- **Code Editor**: A code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for efficiently working with the exercises and running tests.
